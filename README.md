# 🧠 Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of several core **design patterns** using Java. Each pattern is demonstrated with simple, understandable examples — perfect for learners, interview prep, or as a reference.

---

## 📚 Patterns Included

- **Singleton Pattern** – Ensure only one instance of a class.
- **Strategy Pattern** – Choose algorithm behavior at runtime.
- **Template Method Pattern** – Define algorithm steps in a base class.
- **Decorator Pattern** – Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Proxy Pattern** – Control access to an object.
- **Prototype Pattern** – Create object copies without depending on their concrete classes.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each pattern is organized into its own directory:

Each folder includes:
- Interface or abstract classes
- Concrete implementations
- A demo/test file to run and observe behavior

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/nikhila611/design-patterns-in-java.git
   cd design-patterns-in-java
2. Compile and run any pattern demo (example for Singleton):
   javac SingletonPattern/*.java
   java SingletonPattern.TestSingletonPattern1
3. Sample Output:
   [Singleton] Creating a new instance...
   [Strategy] 10 + 5 = 15
   [Template] Boiling water...
   [Proxy] Loading real image...
   [Decorator] Drawing red border...
